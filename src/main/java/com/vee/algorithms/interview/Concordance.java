 * <br>
 * <p> Problem : Given an arbitrary text document written in English, 
 * write a program that will generate a concordance, 
 * i.e. an alphabetical list of all word occurrences, 
 * labeled with word frequencies. 
 * Bonus: label each word with the sentence numbers in which each 
 * occurrence appeared.
 * <pre>
 * a    {2:1,1}
 * all    {1:1}
 * alphabetical     {1:1}
 * an    {2:1,1}
 * appeared    {1:2}
 * arbitrary    {1:1}
 * bonus    {1:2}
 * concordance    {1:1}
 * document    {1:1}
 * each    {2:2,2}
 * english    {1:1}
 * frequencies    {1:1}
 * generate    {1:1}
 * given    {1:1}
 * i.e.    {1:1}
 * in    {2:1,2}
 * label    {1:2}
 * labeled    {1:1}
 * list    {1:1}
 * numbers    {1:2}
 * occurrence    {1:2}
 * occurrences    {1:1}
 * of    {1:1}
 * program    {1:1}
 * sentence    {1:2}
 * text    {1:1}
 * that    {1:1}
 * the    {1:2}
 * which    {1:2}
 * will    {1:1}
 * with    {2:1,2}
 * word    {3:1,1,2}
 * write    {1:1}
 * written    {1:1}
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Solution: Uses BreakIterator <br><br>
 * 
 * Assumptions:
 * <ul>A newline character doesn't mean a sentence ending. A sentence ending
 * should be a sentence punctuation. E.g.
 * <pre>You are
 *welcome</pre>
 * is one sentence instead of 2
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Known Issues:</p>
 * <li> Has problems with email addresses</li>
 * <li> Has problems with currencies 4.3$</li>
 * <li>
 * A sentence not beginning with Caps is part of previous sentence. E.g.
 * <pre>Impossible. i can't imagine.</pre>
 * has only 1 sentence
 * </li>
